Fully-automatic, on-chain, open-source, pump.fun solana MEVbot leveraging Jito flashloans and the minimal gas fees of Solana to perform sandwich attacks and front-runs with the ability to target coins and wallets on https://pump.fun.

  

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the atomic nature of Flashloan operations, if they aren't profitable the transaction will revert and no net profit will be lost.

- Onchain, the engine watches pump's Solana master SPL for user buys, sells, and token creations that contain exploitable slippage deficits.

> [!TIP]
> Bot operators can target any transaction value within their balance threshold. Generally, higher thresholds net consistently viable transactions

- Once a transaction is identified, a flashloan is initiated for the target transaction amount, this requires a marginal amount of collateral.

- The bot will aggressively attempt to front-run the transaction by dynamically monitoring the miner bribe and increasing it if necessary, so as to compete with other traders, and aim be the first transaction mined.

- Depending on the set parameters, the bot will either front-run the Dev's sell to remain in profit, or sell upon the token reaching KOTH. Users can close active transactions at any time.

- The flashloan is then repaid, collateral is reiumbursed and profits are deposited into the operators wallet.

- If the transaction is unprofitable at any point it will be reverted and the flashloan will be repaid, losing no gas or net profit.

# Tips

  

- Make sure Violentmonkey isn't in developer mode otherwise the dashboard wont run. Additionally this keeps your browser environment safe.

  

- Increase the flashloan limit by .5 - 1 SOL if you want to target more than one or two coins at a time.
